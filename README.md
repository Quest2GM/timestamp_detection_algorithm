### YOLOv3 Timestamp Localization Performance
| *Detection*        | *Images*      |
|:------------------:|:-------------:|
| Correct Detection  | 754           |
| False Detection    | 5             |
| No Detection       | 2             |
| *Accuracy*         | *96.9%*       |

### Digit Recognition Algorithm Performance

### Speed
Averages around 3 seconds for localization and detection combined.
